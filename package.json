  "description": "Set against the vibrant backdrop of Gourmetville is a culinary crown jewel – the annual “Feastival Showdown”. This three-day event invites the city’s top home chefs, often accompanied by their families and friends, to create mouth-watering masterpieces. The competition's design is one of unity and collaboration, with teams consisting of 4 or 5 members, be it solo chefs, pairs, trios, or larger groups. The event days correspond to the courses each team will be creating: appetizers light up the first day, entrées take center stage on the second, and desserts sweeten the conclusion on the third. Attendees have the honor of optionally rating each dish on a scale of 1-10, with the aggregate point tally crowning the next Feastival Champion. In an effort to elevate the festival's experience, the organizational team has hired us to design a database capable of allowing it to scale and maintain historical data by tracking its yearly popularity through ticket sales, attendee counts, team makeup and competitors, and food entries. It will currently track 20 eclectic teams, and a combined talent of 80 to 100 chefs, participating to win top prize. The event is expected to draw crowds of 2,000 attendees or more, with our system monitoring ticket sales which will be segmented based on single-day, two-day, and three-day tickets.",
